We start where you are—then build a roadmap that 10×'s efficiency.  
**Deliverables:** current-state audit, ROI model, 6-month action plan.  
**Ideal for:** CEOs who know AI is crucial but need a pragmatic path.

Your model is only as good as the pipeline that supports it.  
We set up Realtime retraining, Dockerised LLM inference on Cloud Run, and CI/CD that keeps costs predictable.
